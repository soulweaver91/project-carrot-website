Project Carrot website
======================

This is the source code for the website for [Project Carrot](https://github.com/soulweaver91/project-carrot),
available at [https://carrot.soulweaver.fi/](https://carrot.soulweaver.fi/).

Building
--------

A modern version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is required.

```shell
npm install -g gulp-cli
npm install
gulp build
```

The output will be in the `dist` folder. Deployment command will be implemented later.
